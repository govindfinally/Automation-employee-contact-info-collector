> 🚀 Automating company outreach research using **Selenium** & **Hunter.io** for instant email + LinkedIn data extraction, all neatly saved into Excel.

---

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project is a **fully automated data enrichment tool** that:

1. Reads a list of company names from an Excel file 📂
2. Uses **Selenium WebDriver** to navigate to [Hunter.io](https://hunter.io/domain-search) 🔍
3. Searches each company, scrapes:

   * ✅ Domain
   * ✅ Employee names
   * ✅ Email addresses
   * ✅ Job positions
   * ✅ LinkedIn presence indicator
4. Appends the results into an **existing Excel sheet** without duplicates 📊

## ✨ Why This Project Stands Out

* **⚡ End-to-End Automation** – From input to output, no manual clicks needed.
* **🛡️ Robust Error Handling** – Skips failed searches, keeps going without crashing.
* **📈 Scalable** – Can handle hundreds of companies in a single run.
* **🔄 Data Integrity** – Automatically merges with existing outreach lists and removes duplicates.
* **💼 Real-World Use Case** – Ideal for sales, recruitment, and marketing teams.
